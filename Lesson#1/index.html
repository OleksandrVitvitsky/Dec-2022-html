    <strong>Homer Jay Simpson</strong> (born May 12, 1956)[40] is a man from Springfield. He is the spouse of Marge
    Simpson and father of
    Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be 239 pounds)[41], lazy, and often ignorant to the

    cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't.

    Lisa has yellow skin, blue eyes (although the pupils look like 2 black dots just like the other characters), and a
    blonde “starfish
    " hairstyle that is styled into points and matches the color of her skin. She doesn’t have any visible hairline.
    She’s usually seen wearing a short, strapless vermillion dress with a zigzag hem, matching red Mary-Jane shoes, and
    a white pearl necklace (given to her by Marge).
